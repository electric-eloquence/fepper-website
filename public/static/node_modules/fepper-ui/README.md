# Client-side package that powers the Fepper UI

### Install

This package is automatically installed with a normal Fepper installation. To 
install it manually:

```shell
* cd public
* npm install
```

### Update

```shell
* cd public
* npm update
```

### Customize

All aspects of the UI are available for customization. For example, the toolbar
can accept additions, modifications, and deletions per the needs of end-users. 
However, the customizations need to be made in your `source` directory, and are 
not directly relevant to this package.

See the [Fepper README](https://github.com/electric-eloquence/fepper#ui-customization) 
for more information.
