# Please refer to http://patternlab.io/docs/pattern-adding-annotations.html for
# documentation on annotating Fepper patterns. We recommend using the Pattern
# Lab-specific syntax for Markdown as opposed to the older, poorly documented
# JSON (or JavaScript?) method.

# This file is the source for global annotations. Annotations can also be added
# to patterns locally by writing Markdown files in the directory containing the
# Mustache pattern.
